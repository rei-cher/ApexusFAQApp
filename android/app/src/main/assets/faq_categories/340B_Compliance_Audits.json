        "question": "Can a manufacturer audit a covered entity?",
        "answer": "Yes, section 340B (a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act allows manufacturers to audit a covered entity to ensure compliance with 340B drug diversion and duplicate discount prohibitions and requires entities to permit manufacturers to audit records related to compliance with these prohibitions.   A manufacturer must first attempt to resolve issues in good faith with the covered entity.   If good faith efforts fail, the manufacturer must submit an audit work plan and reasonable cause justification to HRSA prior to conducting the audit.  For more information, please refer to the 340B Program Policy Release here:https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/opa/manufacturer-audit-clarification-11-21-11.pdf."

        "question": "How does HRSA define the term \"breach\" that is used in the recertification statements? (Ref: \"the covered entity acknowledges its responsibility to contact OPA as soon as reasonably possible if there is a change in 340B eligibility and/or breach by the covered entity of any of the foregoing...\")",
        "answer": "The term breach in this context refers to an instance of non-compliance with any of the 340B Program requirements. The covered entity upon recertification attests to contact OPA when there is a breach of 340B requirements.  To increase program transparency among all stakeholders and ensure that covered entities can rely on a reasonable threshold to guide consistent and effective self-disclosure decision-making, it is recommended that covered entities define âmaterial breachâ for their organizations and establish a process for self-disclosure in their policies and procedures.
