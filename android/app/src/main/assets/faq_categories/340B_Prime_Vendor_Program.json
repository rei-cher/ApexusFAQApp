        "question": "What opportunity exists for the vendors to partner with the Apexusâ Prime Vendor Program?",
        "answer": "The Apexus PVP is an outpatient pharmacy program that secures sub-340B contract pricing on medications that by law have a 340B statutory price.  The PVP also contracts for other value-added products and services that an outpatient ambulatory pharmacy would use and/or dispense.  If your products or services fall outside this scope, we are most likely unable to partner with you.  Please contact John Barnes, Associate Vice President of Contracting Services at 469-299-7311 or via email atJohn.Barnes@Apexus.com."

        "question": "What recommendations can you provide regarding ensuring the information our entity has received regarding 340B policy is accurate?",
        "answer": "Covered entities should refer to the 340B statute, HRSA published guidance, and HRSA policy releases (http://www.hrsa.gov/opa/programrequirements/index.html) to confirm the accuracy of 340B policy.  HRSA establishes 340B policy and communicates via policy releases, its website and through email communication.  In addition, HRSA uses the HRSA contracted 340B Prime Vendor Program, managed by Apexus, to assist in communicating that policy.HRSA cannot ensure the accuracy of information provided by other sources beyond Apexus PVP.  Covered entities that are either unsure of past HRSA guidance or information received beyond HRSA or Apexus PVP should contact the Apexus Answers Call Center (https://www.340bpvp.com/apexus-answers) to validate the information.   Covered entities should also use their own legal counsel to assist in ensuring compliance with 340B program requirements.  Liability for compliance with 340B program requirements resides with the covered entity."

        "question": "If I do not have an in-house pharmacy, contracted pharmacy arrangement, or relationship with a distributor, do I need to list a distributor when completing the 340B PVP participation agreement?",
        "answer": "340B PVP participants do not need to designate an in-house pharmacy or a contracted pharmacy arrangement on the 340B PVP Participation Agreement when only accessing contracted products which are sold direct from the manufacturer. This is the case with most of the vaccines on contract with the PVP. Entities are advised to select a preferred pharmacy wholesaler from those available on the 340B PVP public website in order to have access to the many other discounted products available on the PVP catalog. A listing of Authorized PVP Distributors can be found athttps://www.340bpvp.com/distribution/distribution-network."

        "answer": "Vaccines purchased through the PVP that are not covered outpatient drugs are classified as value-added products within the Prime Vendor Program. The use of vaccines purchased through the PVP are limited by the terms and conditions of the contract between the PVP and the supplier, including contractual class of trade restrictions.

        "question": "Once enrolled in the PVP, how will I receive the programâs discounted pricing?",
        "answer": "After submitting the enrollment online, you will receive an email providing instruction on how to access the 340B PVP secured website where you can view contract and pricing information.  The pharmacy distributor you select during the online enrollment process also receives electronic notification of your approved participation agreement, referencing your effective date.  Your pharmacy distributor will then link the PVP contract portfolio to your 340B outpatient account(s) and the prime vendor pricing will overlay the PHS/340B-ceiling price for each NDC in the PVP contract portfolio.  The prime vendor pricing has a special code for easy identification that varies by distributor.  Having the prime vendor price overlay the higher 340B ceiling price on products ensures the participants receive the lowest pricing available on the product."

Apexus is unable to provide assurances or statements of stakeholder compliance. Â Â Entities should contact their own legal counsel, have auditable records and policies and procedures in place to reflect compliance with all 340B Program requirements.Regarding vendors: Apexus has secured agreements to offer value-added pharmacy related products and services to its participants. Apexus has reviewed these services and deemed that they have the potential for promoting 340B compliance, but they may have features that entities choose to active or inactivate.

        "question": "Can our facility (which is not a hospital subject to the GPO prohibition) participate in the Apexus Prime Vendor Program and another group purchasing organization (GPO)?",
        "answer": "Unlike hospitals participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, there is no GPO prohibition that applies to all other HRSA grantees.  Therefore, a grantee may elect to participate in more than one group purchasing arrangement.  Apexus Prime Vendor Program (PVP) participation is voluntary, and there are no restrictions placed on those grantees electing to participate.  Most alternative purchasing groups serving 330 grantees encourage participation in the PVP to ensure members have access to best pricing on pharmaceuticals while offering members their own contract portfolios of medical/surgical, dental, office, and other non-pharmacy supplies, which tend to be complimentary to the PVP pharmacy portfolio.  On occasion, there may be an alternative purchasing group that does not permit a member to simultaneously access their own contracts and PVP contracts due to existing business relationships with a supply partner.  In this situation, the grantee may be required to notify the alternative purchasing group to cancel its membership before the selected pharmacy wholesaler will load the PVP pricing available to the entityâs pharmacy account."
