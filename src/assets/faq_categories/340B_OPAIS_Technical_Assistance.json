        "question": "What are best practices for entities when a product does not have a 340B price available, or the product is unavailable?",
        "answer": "Some best practices include:1. Check the labeler code on 340B OPAIS (https://340bopais.hrsa.gov/manufacturersearch), and check the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program labeler code (https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/0ad65fe5-3ad3-5d79-a3f9-7893ded7963a) to help determine if the drug is a covered outpatient drug in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subsequently should have a 340B price.2. Review official resources for reported shortages.3. If the product is NOT listed on the shortage websites, contact the wholesaler and/or manufacturer to confirm unavailability, and assess target date for availability.  If an entity is still unable to obtain the product at the 340B price, notify OPA detailing the covered outpatient drug(s) involved, the manufacturer, and the communication between the parties as to why the product was not available at 340B pricing, by submitting the HRSA Template Notification Tool: Unavailable 340B Pricehttps://www.340bpvp.com/Documents/Public/340B%20Tools/340B-ceiling-price-unavailable-incorrect-340b-ceiling-price-notification-for-hrsa.pdf"

        "question": "Why may the price be different on OPAIS than what I see on my wholesaler catalog?",
        "answer": "The 340B Package Adjusted Price and 340B ceiling price may look different than the 340B selling price (price seen in a wholesaler catalog) for a number of reasons. These may include sub-340B contracts (PVP or individual), wholesaler fees (commonly a percentage added to or subtracted from the total cost of the product), and differences in quantities (for example, between the case size in OPAIS and a package size in the wholesaler system). If a covered entity believes they have been overcharged after researching the issue, they may complete a â340B Ceiling Price Unavailable/Incorrect 340B Ceiling Price Notification for HRSAâ form, which can be found on the 340B Prime Vendorâs website athttps://www.340bpvp.com/resource-center/340b-tools"

        "answer": "For recertification in 340B OPAIS, the AO is notified of dates, times, and requirements of recertification via their listed email in 340B OPAIS. The AO has access via their 340B OPAIS user account-landing page where the AO has access to all 340B records their linked to and those that require annual recertification. At the start of covered entity recertification, a task is created in the PCâs task list for each 340B record that must be recertified. The same task is created in the AOâs task list. Either the PC or the AO can complete recertification for a covered entity record, but only the AO can attest and submit it to OPA. If the PC completes recertification for a covered entity record, that creates a task in the AOâs task list. The AO can make changes if necessary before attesting and submitting to OPA."

        "question": "How many AOs and PCs can a covered entity or manufacturer have in 340B OPAIS?",
        "answer": "Authorized covered entities and manufacturers are only granted one AO and one PC per 340B record. A 340B record is defined as an individual manufacturer labeler code or covered entity 340B ID. For covered entity hospitals and their outpatient facilities, as well as community health centers and their associated grant sites, each record has one AO and one PC per record.  There is a requirement for hospital covered entity types that the AO be the same for all child sites, but the PC may be a separate person for each record.  For example, hospital A with three outpatient facilities has the same AO for all records, but may select a separate PC for each record.  While each record has only one AO and PC, the PC is not required to be the same person on each record. Manufacturers with multiple labeler codes may select different AOs and PCs for each labeler code."
