        "question": "How should we bill our Medicaid agency for fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid when we use 340B drugs to fill Medicaid prescriptions?",
        "answer": "HRSA recommends that covered entities refer to their respective state Medicaid agency drug reimbursement guidelines for applicable billing requirements. Seehttps://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/opa/federal-register-12-15-2000.pdf.In addition, to improve transparency and assist stakeholders with 340B compliance, the 340B Prime Vendor has gathered 340B Medicaid information from multiple federal and state Medicaid sources and compiled them in one location.

        "question": "May covered entities list the Medicaid provider numbers of healthcare professionals on the HRSA Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) if that is the only billing identifier submitted on the claim?",
        "answer": "A covered entity site may list a health care professionalâs Medicaid provider number on the Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) if the health care professionalâs Medicaid provider number is listed as the billing provider on the Medicaid billing form (for example, box 56 or box 57 on a CMS 1450 (UB-04) claim form).The MEF contains all covered entity sites that will bill Medicaid FFS for drugs purchased at 340B prices, and the state(s) and associated billing numbers listed on the claims to bill Medicaid FFS for 340B drugs. This may include the billing providerâs national provider identifier (NPI) only, state assigned Medicaid number only, or both NPI and state assigned Medicaid number.Covered entities should refer to state Medicaid agencies as to whether a particular Medicaid billing identifier is appropriate under the particular circumstance.In addition, if a covered entity site (340B ID) answers âyesâ to the following question in 340B OPAIS: âAt this site, will the covered entity bill Medicaid fee-for-service for drugs purchased at 340B prices?â the site must also provide, each Medicaid state it plans to bill, and the billing number(s) it will list on the bill to the state. Billing number(s) may include the billing providerâs national provider identifier (NPI) only, state assigned Medicaid number only, or both NPI and state assigned Medicaid number. This information listed for each covered entity site (340B ID) in OPAIS is used to generate a quarterly Medicaid Exclusion File, which is an official data source used by stakeholders to determine which covered entity sites bill Medicaid for 340B drugs."

        "question": "In the HRSA Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF), what does the âstart dateâ and the âterm dateâ mean? Also, when may a covered entity request a change to the information on the MEF, and when will that change be considered âliveâ on the 340B OPAIS?",
        "answer": "The date in the âstart dateâ column is the first date that the entity began participating in the 340B Program. The date in the âterm dateâ column is the effective date the entity is no longer participating in the 340B Program. These dates DO NOT relate to the covered entityâs MEF determination as carve in or carve out for Medicaid fee-for-service. To download the MEF for a specific quarter, on the MEF homepage in the 340B OPAIS a quarterly date range must be selected and those dates reflect the effective dates of the selected MEF download. Please note that the MEF only applies to Medicaid fee-for-service.A change to the 340B MEF may be requested at any time, but changes do not take effect until the 1st day of the following quarter and only if approved by OPA before the time it takes a quarterly snapshot of carve-in/carve-out decisions. Covered entities should time their change in actual 340B Medicaid billing practice to coincide with the first day of the quarter that reflects the new billing status. The 340B OPAIS takes a snapshot of carve-in/out decisions at 12:01am ET on the 16th day of the month prior to the start of each quarter, irrespective of weekends or holidays. Covered entities are therefore encouraged to submit carve in/carve out decisions before HRSA takes its quarterly snapshot to provide sufficient time to process and approve the request.

        "answer": "Duplicate discounts are prohibited for Medicaid FFS and MCO drugs pursuant to section 340B(a)(5)(A) of the Public Health Service Act. The data included in the Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) applies to drugs billed under Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS). HRSA encourages covered entities to work with states and their respective MCOs to develop strategies to prevent duplicate discounts. In some cases, states have placed certain requirements on covered entities regarding the prevention of duplicate discounts for drugs billed to MCOs.Covered entities report using a variety of methods to prevent duplicate discounts for MCO claims. For example, identification of MCOs by bank identification numbers (BIN) and/or processor control numbers (PCN); use of National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) codes for claims submitted through a pharmacy operating system; use of claim modifier codes for physician administered drugs; and submission of drug costs as part of a bundled or capitated rate."

        "answer": "Covered entities are prohibited by section 340B(a)(5)(A) of the Public Health Service Act from billing 340B drugs to Medicaid if they are subject to a rebate claim by the state.

A covered entity site can add its 340B ID to the MEF to reflect that it will carve in at least one state Medicaid for the quarter.
