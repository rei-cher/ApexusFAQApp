        "question": "If our contract pharmacy has been purchased by another pharmacy, do we need to update our records with OPA?",
        "answer": "If a contract pharmacy has changed ownership, HRSA considers this to be a new contract pharmacy arrangement. The covered entity must have a written contract in place with the new contract pharmacy and register the contract pharmacy arrangement on 340B OPAIS prior to use. Covered entities must complete the online portion of the contract pharmacy registration process during an open registration period. For instructions on how to register a contract pharmacy please refer to the user guide under the \"Help\" section in 340B OPAIS.The covered entity must also terminate the contract pharmacy relationship established under the previous owners. To effectuate the termination, complete an online termination request. Failure to report a change in ownership may result in a lapse in 340B access through the specific contract pharmacy."

        "question": "May 340B drugs be used for Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) patients as part of a 340B contract pharmacy?",
        "answer": "340B drugs may not be used for Medicaid FFS patients at a contract pharmacy, absent an arrangement between the contract pharmacy, covered entity, and state Medicaid agency to prevent duplicate discounts.

        "question": "What are the record-keeping requirements for contract pharmacies?",
        "answer": "The covered entity must have fully auditable records that demonstrate compliance with all 340B Program requirements and the entity remains responsible for ensuring their contract pharmacies meet statutory obligations to ensure against diversion or duplicate discounts.  HRSA recommends that covered entities perform quarterly internal audits and annual independent audits (or more frequent as necessary) of all their utilized contract pharmacies to ensure 340B Program compliance, although the exact method of ensuring compliance is left up to the entity. HRSA also recommends that covered entities maintain written policies and procedures to describe contract pharmacy oversight activities, including effective procedures for review of the patient eligibility determination system used at contract pharmacies, and reconciliation of dispensing, purchasing, and billing records to ensure that diversion and duplicate discounts have not occurred.In addition, and as a best practice, the contract pharmacy provides the covered entity with reports consistent with customary business practices (e.g. quarterly billing statements, status report of collections and receiving and dispensing records). The contract pharmacy, with the assistance of the covered entity, establish and maintain a tracking system suitable to prevent diversion of 340B drugs and duplicate discounts on the drugs. The contract pharmacy assures that all pertinent reimbursement accounts and dispensing records, maintained by the pharmacy, will be accessible separately from the pharmacyâs own operations and will be made available to the covered entity, HRSA, and the manufacturer in the case of an audit."

        "question": "If a contract pharmacy is serving more than one covered entity, and it keeps the inventories physically separate for each entity, may the pharmacy arrange for one inventory to borrow from another if it is running low of a particular drug?",
        "answer": "No, a contract pharmacy serving more than one covered entity may not arrange for one inventory to borrow from another if it is running low of a particular drug. In this contract pharmacy situation, the contract pharmacy keeps physically separate inventories for each separate 340B ID# it does not use a replenishment model. The physically separate 340B inventories belong to different 340B entities. Borrowing from one 340B ID/covered entityâs inventory to give to another 340B entityâs places the entity at risk for diversion."

        "question": "Our contract pharmacy uses a repackager at a separate address from the contract pharmacy to process 340B prescriptions. Must we register the repackager on 340B OPAIS?",
        "answer": "The covered entity is not required to register the repackager as a contract pharmacy so long as:(1) the covered entity retains ownership and title to the 340B drugs;(2) the covered entity will not sell its 340B drugs or otherwise transfer ownership to the repackager; and (3) the repackager will not dispense 340B drugs.Based on those specific circumstances, and the fact that the repackager is not a pharmacy and will not dispense drugs, OPA does not require the repackager to register as a contract pharmacy."

If the 15th falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the deadline for submitting contract pharmacy registrations will be the next business day. HRSA will not post a retroactive date for any contract pharmacy arrangement; as such, the date that the organization submitted the registration request should not be presumed the effective date.
